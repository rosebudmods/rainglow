## features
- 15+ different available colours!
- lightweight and removable - after removing the mod, your glow squids will simply revert to blue with no damage to your save file
- server sync - the configuration file can be synced from the server to the client, meaning that all players on your server will use the same options. documentation on this can be found [here](https://github.com/ix0rai/rainglow/wiki/server-sync)
- custom modes - modes are data-driven, meaning that you can create your own modes and add them to the game! documentation on this can be found [here](https://github.com/ix0rai/rainglow/wiki/creating-custom-modes)

#### server-side optional!
This mod does not need to be installed on the server to function!
It works from the client side, so you can install it on your client and play on any server without needing to ask the server owner to install it.
However, without a server installation glow squids will forget their colours when you leave the world and get new random ones when you rejoin.
Colours cannot be synced between players without installing rainglow on the server.

### available modes
##### basic
- rainbow - red, orange, yellow, lime, green, blue, indigo, violet
- all colours - just what the name says
- monochrome - white, grey, and black
- custom - allows you to set your own colours
##### pride

- lesbian pride - red, orange, white, pink and purple
- bisexual pride - blue, pink and purple
